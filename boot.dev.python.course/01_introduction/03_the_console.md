# The Console (in Python)
---

## The Console 

The "console" shows you the text output of your program. It's right
beneath the code editor.

To see what's happening in our code, we need to _print it to the
console_ by using the `print()` function.

We'll learn more about functions later, but for now, just know that
`print()` function will print anything you put inside its parentheses,
like this:

```python

print("Greetings, adventurer!")

```

## Assignment

We need to greet our new players! __Print the following text__ to the
console:

__Greetings, Adventurer__

## Assignment Code (as is)

```python

```

## Assignment Code (fixed)

```python
print("Greetings, adventurer!")
```

## Proper, Fixed Output:
```
Greetings, adventurer!
```
